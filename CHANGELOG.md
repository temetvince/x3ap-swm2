### Top 20 changes from "vanilla" Mayhem 2:

1.	All vanilla factions changed to star wars factions.
	*	Kha'ak faction changed to Rogue Mining Droids.
	*	Xenon faction changed to Sith.
	*	Pirate faction changed to the Hutts.
	*	Hutts and Sith are extremely dangerous. Race fleets can combat them more effectively if you raise your threat level.

2.	All vanilla ships removed from the game (except Xenon ships).

3.	Most wares are now universally Star Wars based!

4.	Main story changed to follow Star Wars lore. A large amount of artistic license was used. ;)

5.	Faction capital ships can be renamed in the addon/t/9978_L044.xml file. Name them after your friends or favorite characters!

6.	New game starts. Optionally join the Rebellion or Fight for the Empire.

7.	Many Mayhem 2 balance changes in addon/t/9972-L044.xml.

8.	Difficulty (starting threat level) can be set in addon/t/9972-L044.xml.

9.	Revamped attack scripts - Fighters & corvettes will temporarily remove themselves from battle if they're running low on energy. Energy efficiency matters!

10.	Default ship equipment overhauled. Many now come with Quantum Jump Gate Extensions, Transporter Devices, Docking Transporter Extensions, and Triplex Scanners, to name a few.

11.	All sanctuaries build faster and start with the tax, solar panels, adjacency, and resupply drone perks for free (use missiles now, as they are much cheaper and the resupply drone will resupply ships parked outside your sanctuaries so long as they stock missiles!)

12.	Ships automatically orient themselves upright with respect to the gate network. No more upside down or sideways ships.

13.	Corporations are randomly placed within their race's territory and will respawn if destroyed after a while. Corporations maintain military fleets for protection from the war.

14.	You can teleport to any of your ships using the Player Console. This will reset the ship's homebase unless it is part of a wing.

15.	Factions will now use M4, M5, and M8 in their Battle Fleets. Be on guard!

16.	Dock/Station Agents will pick up on Homebase trading range changes on the fly and will adjust jump e-cells accordingly.	

17.	Satellite Monitoring now respects all player property, not just satellites.

18.	Mayhem Ferry bug fixed.

19.	Explorers will randomly pick their gates instead of all following the same path.

20.	All factions fight dirty wars. This should help late game balance and instill chaos across the galaxy.
