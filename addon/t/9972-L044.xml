		<t id="2000">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #202\033X[/author]Our lead scientists finally managed to polarize the Infinity Gate Portal, and we are now in a deep unknown portion of the galaxy, far far away from home. Hopefully, those murderous droids won't be able to follow us after we blew up the portal, but we never know.\n\nThe previous entries of my diary are like the stories of a stranger. All the dramatic events I've told these past months are now distant memories, and the only times I will get to see our worlds again are in my dreams.\n\nWith the help of the survivors, we have managed to setup our headquarters, here, in the middle of nowhere. We got the coordinates of this place from an alien Holocron that claims it predates even the Old Republic by thousands of years, who calls itself The Cataclysm. The ancient race lived here a long time ago, inside invisible stations to hide from their aggressors.\n\nEvery time I use my Battle Meditation I see a blue portal floating in the empty horizon, a hyperlane route I'm sure. Where does it lead? We don't know, and I'm the only Sohnen Jedi left to explore and find the answer. I must hurry though, the people will starve very soon if I don't manage to find some food.\n\n\033YTutorial: you can see how much food your people have left by accessing the Sanctuary Manager directly through the Property menu. At this point, make sure you setup the new hotkeys in the Interface Control menu. You should now start exploring the rest of this region of space and see if there's any opportunity, such as flying wares or bailed ships.</t>
		<t id="2001">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #203\033X[/author]What a relief! We didn't crash into an unknown star! I knew the coordinates in my meditations were correct. I've discovered a new sector and there's plenty of life here.\n\nMy encyclopedia updated a few minutes ago. This sector appears to be controlled by a group who call themselves the Rebel Alliance. There's a lot of activity going on and nobody seems to have noticed me.\n\n\033YTutorial: you will see these tutorial messages until you reach the end of the Omicron Channel, at which point the dynamic war will be triggered. In the meantime, try to make some money in order to buy food or Advanced Satellites. You can sell some of the resources you have in your Sanctuary if you need more credits. Don't forget to take a look at the products that are traded by local merchants, because you probably are going to do things manually for a while. A list of local merchants can be found in your Personal Console.\n\nA good starting factory would be one that makes Durasteel, as it is somewhat rare in this section of the galaxy and is necessary to build more factories. Also, one of the most efficient foods to feed your people are Fried Porg Wings.\n\nDon't let your people starve!</t>
		<t id="2002">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #204\033X[/author]I met the Republic and now the Confederacy of Independent Systems, or thankfully CIS for short. I've downloaded some data about this place, and it seems big enough for our civilization to rise again.\n\n\033YTutorial: in Mayhem, you capture new sectors by using the hotkey available in your Controls Menu, or going through the Personal Console. However, you need to destroy all stations in a sector before you can control it and be able to build your own stations. But right now this is not your priority. You must develop your sector first.</t>
		<t id="2003">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #205\033X[/author]Apparently, the empires in this region of the galaxy survived an invasion from terrifying rogue droids a year ago. They are talking about the same ships we saw destroying our worlds and killing our people. The call them the Omicron Chanel Virus, or OCV. Let's hope they never return.</t>
		<t id="2004">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #206\033X[/author]This area is far from a paradise after all. A few wars are going on between old alliances. The Rebel Alliance and the New Republic versus the CIS and the Mandalorians. I keep hearing references to The Cataclysm of the Ages, which seems to have brought all of these civilizations together from different eras just as it brought us here. Old hostilities were shaken off to fight the OCV when it appeared, and now that the common enemy has been destroyed, it seems that everyone wants a bigger piece of the pie. I should warn my people, find new sectors and start building other sanctuaries, because I'm pretty sure that things are going to get worse.\n\n\033YTutorial: continue exploring these new sectors for now. Your priority is to get out of the Omicron Channel while making sure that your people don't starve.</t>
		<t id="2005">[author]\033GBreaking news\033X[/author]Today, an unknown source revealed important information about how the war against the OCV really happened. It seems that the New Republic were trying to avoid the battle of Cerberus Alpha and did not help the Rebel Alliance at all. The source also claimed that he's in possession of some evidence related to the corruption of the Republic, and how they were making money while people were getting killed. More information on that later.\n\n\033YTutorial: relations between races in Mayhem are pretty unstable. Be sure to know who is allied to whom by looking at your Ministry Of War menu. You will notice in this menu that there are a few outsider companies that profit from war by looting wares and capturing bailed ships. They all have a faction they dislike: a Nemesis. The more you are hostile towards their Nemesis and complete missions for them, the more they're going to like you.</t>
		<t id="2006">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #207\033X[/author]Cobra Gamma, the Mandalorians. They don't seem friendly...\n\nI've finally managed to repair the ship Data Scanner. This portable device can analyze a ship by hacking its systems and gives our engineers the ability to rebuild the entire hull from various resources. I must be careful though, the target will probably notice the intrusion...\n\n\033YTutorial: you can now access your Research Station menu, from which you can spend time on various ship blueprint projects. Ship data must be acquired before you can research them, using the Data Scanner \(hotkey\). Note that research projects can be interrupted and resumed at any time, and that several Research Stations can work on the same project. If needed, you'll find a handy command in the Additional Ship Commands Menu to add your own ships data to your database. Note that the naming convention can be ambiguous: Ship Blueprint is a finished project, and you need a Ship Blueprint to build ships. Ship Data is the requirement to start researching a Ship Blueprint at your Research Stations. Data Scanner, as the name suggests, only acquires Ship Data for you.</t>
		<t id="2007">[author]\033GBreaking news\033X[/author]Tensions are rising. This morning, the Rebels manifested their discontent about the recent revelation surrounding their old allies, the New Republic, and they said, "They should now be considered as traitors".\n\nThe war has not been declared yet, but we've heard some very disturbing rumors about large battle groups being built in core sectors.\n\n\033YTutorial: Invasions in Mayhem can be pretty catastrophic, and most races will destroy each other's stations in battle. As a grey Jedi with a civlization to build, you are more concerned with what future trading opportunities will inevitably arise in the resulting unbalanced economy.\n\nA race can invade another race if the relation between them is neutral.\n\nBeware of the OCV! Soon you will become a threat and they will frequently launch waves of fleet directly into your territory. You will be warned before the attack \(you can see how much time you have left at the top section of the Ministry of War screen\).</t>
		<t id="2008">\033YTutorial: Each Sanctuary works with the help of your people. The more people you have, the faster you will build what you need. To acquire more people, you can capture roaming astronauts, or wait for the natural growth. Note that you can use the Backlog in your Personal Console to queue different projects. See the Miscellaneous section of the in-game Encyclopedia for more information about that.</t>
		<t id="2009">[author]\033GBreaking news\033X[/author]Dear citizen, the news is getting worse. The Mandalorians have declared war against all doctrines, arguing that the Way of Mandalore should be above everything else. Of course, this is only a pretext to conquer more sectors, and they already have taken over Leap Of Faith, as if it were a pirate sector.\n\nThe CIS is furious, and the Rebel alliances just said a few minutes ago that they will always defend the Jedi, their faithful allies. However, they seem the only faction willing to defend their famous temples...\n\n\033YTutorial: all features of Mayhem are now activated and all default vanilla alliances have been broken. The universe is all yours, and if you look nearby, you will find a very useful ship. You can also take a look at the Ascension system, through your Personal Console. At the end of the 5 Ascension levels, you will gain a modest reward, but to do that, you will have to complete various achievements that will probably change the way you intended to develop your empire. If you fail your Ascension, you will be able to restart it for 1 threat. At this time of the game, it would also be a good thing to setup a surveillance network, with your own Advanced Satellites. Good luck!\n\nFor more information about Mayhem, take a look at the "help" section of the in-game Encyclopedia. Mayhem is full of features and one playthrough is rarely enough to know them all!</t>
		
		<t id="2010">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #209\033X[/author]I don't know how we managed to do it, but we're still alive somehow. My entire fleet experienced a catastrophic hyperlance accident, and we got transported into an unknown part of the galaxy. There's a lot of activity going on, and nobody seems to have noticed us. I should look around and find a suitable home sector for us to rebuild. Hopefully the murderous droids chasing us can't follow us here, but I'm not so sure. I wouldn't be suprised if it was their fault we experienced the accident in the first place!\n\n...According to these freshly downloaded Encyclopedia entries, droids matching the same description as the ones chasing us attacked the factions in this part of the galaxy several years ago. How numerous are they?! The locals here call them the Omicron Channel Virus, or OCV for short. This is not good... \n\n\033YTutorial: for more information about Mayhem, take a look at the "help" section of the in-game encyclopedia.

		<t id="2011">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #209\033X[/author]The OCV was burning hot on our trail when the accident occured. I feel a great disturbance in the Force; I fear they will attack us often. I must prepare!</t>
		
		<t id="2012">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #209\033X[/author]Several weeks have passed since my arrival in this section of the galaxy. At first, I thought the ruler factions were friendly, but yesterday one of them attacked my ships without undue provocation. They attacked so quickly I did not even have time to use my Battle Meditation! Who were they kidding? Didn't they see that this meant war? They must have believed me too weak to fight back.\n\nIt became clear to me then that I had to form an alliance with the aggressor's enemy, a powerful entity, if I were to survive here. While I doubt the agressor will ever forgive me for the war I am about to declare, I also know that alliances can be fickle things as well. I should maximize the benefits of this alliance while I can, until my empire is strong enough to stand on its own. Only then can I stand a chance to defeat the OCV.</t>
		
		<t id="2013">[author]\033MJedi Council[/author]Greetings Grey Jedi! And welcome to our sectors.\n\nWe have been waiting for you for a while now, watching all your steps wisely. You are in friendly territory here, as we honor an old alliance that once existed between the Jedi and the Sohnens.\n\nOur generation does not remember this pact, but the archives tell us dozens of stories about a peaceful agreement between our two peoples. Our ancestors and yours came here a long time ago through the Cataclysm as allies, and today, we would like to ask for your help, as our universe is falling into chaos. People need to remember the Living Force binds the galaxy together, and that the Jedi Council knows the will of The Force.\n\nPlease use your industrious factories to build at least 5 of our ETA-2 Jedi Starfighters. These are peacekeeping ships that will spread our doctrine to all stations they can reach.\n\nLet people see that even during war time, the Force desires peace and community. Give them hope!</t>
		<t id="2014">[author]\033MJedi Council[/author]Thank you Grey Jedi, the ships are perfect. Make them roam the galaxy to give courage and hope to all people! We will contact you again if we need more help.</t>
		<t id="2015">[author]\033MJedi' Council[/author]Grey Jedi,\n\nWe come to you once again to ask for your help. The Xenophobic Sith have conquered one of our sectors, Sanctuary of Darkness, and this is a war we cannot win. Please, use your powerful Battle Meditation and take it back, and we will be forever in your debt.</t>
		<t id="2016">[author]\033MJedi Council[/author]Sanctuary of Darkness is now free of the Sith Xenon, thank you.\n\nOur Jedi Consulars had a Force Vision of you becoming the emperor of all races. They saw you as one of the greatest leaders of our time. But can you handle such power without corruption?\nThey said you must build a Jedi Temple in one of your sectors to be able to access this supreme privilege.\n\nWe just transfered the perk of Jedi Temples to your factories. Only a few of them will be able to build it but it will give your sectors joy and prosperity. Trust us.\n\n\033YJedi Temples increase sector statistics.</t>
		<t id="2017">[author]\033MJedi Council[/author]Grey Jedi,\n\nYou have given hope to our people, fought back the incarnation of evil, and now you have just built one of a great Jedi Temple.

		<t id="2018">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nDuring the last OCV attack, we managed to isolate a strange radio signature coming to their ships. The signal is so weak that it cannot come from a remote part of the galaxy. We are currently investigating it, but we will probably need to face another attack to know more.</t>
		<t id="2019">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nThe OCV threat is growing, but during the last attack we made some progress regarding the strange radio signal we received a few days ago. It appears that this signal is coming from %s, but there's nothing there. At least, nothing we can see...\n\nOne guy in the team thinks that the OCV managed to get their hands on the Cataclysm's cloaking technology. How would they do otherwise? They appear from nowhere and we cannot track them back. That must be it, but we cannot be sure until the OCV launches another attack.</t>
		<t id="2020">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nDuring the last OCV attack, we've made a crucial discovery! As we previously suspected, the OCV is using a cloaking device on their ships, but also on their stations. These stations are here, just around us, but we cannot see them!\n\nWe are trying to build a scanner that could disrupt their signal and reveal the positions of their stations. If we see them, we can destroy them and get rid of them once and for all.</t>
		<t id="2021">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nOur team has scanned the OCV ships during the last attack and they have enough information to fine tune our OCV Station scanner prototype. You can now build one of them inside each Sanctuary using Perks. Unfortunately, it can only scan nearby sectors \(up to 3 jumps\), so we may have to develop our empire if we want to find all the OCV stations.</t>
		<t id="2022">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nWe have found an OCV station in %s, just next to us. What a great discovery! We must destroy it as soon as we can, as the strength of the OCV is growing over time.</t>
		<t id="2023">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nWe have received an outstanding number of radio signals from the OCV station you just destroyed.

		<t id="2024">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nThe OCV has send us a message. It's just a series of number: 2, 5, 9, 2, 0, 0. We don't know what that means yet.</t>
		<t id="2025">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nWe may have found the meaning of the previous OCV message. 259,200... that's the number of seconds that there are in three days.

		<t id="2026">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nWe are receiving many radio signals from all around the universe.

		<t id="2027">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nOn the advice of our military advisors, we have tried to reach all other factions to convince them to focus their strength on the OCV threat.

		<t id="2028">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nThe OCV has just uncloaked all its stations! We must destroy each of them at all costs!</t>

		<t id="4205">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nAs you know, we recently managed to flee from the Sohnen part of the galaxy after opening an Infinity Gate Portal that we destroyed immediately after we got here. Unfortunately, by doing that, we have cut all communications with our home sectors and isolated ourselves. At least, we thought it was the case, until now.\n\nThis morning, a communication has been intercepted from a distant region of space. The message is unclear and the signal is too weak to be understood, but our specialists established that the radio signature is not ours. Leader, there's a chance that this signal comes from the dreaded droids, whom races here call the Omicron Channel Virus, or OCV. Who knows what happened after our escape? Maybe they're still chasing us.\n\nLet us be prepared for all eventualities...\n\n\033YTutorial: OCV can be pretty devastating if you don't properly defend your sectors with patrols and Orbital Weapons Platforms \(they tend to target those platforms first\). They will soon start launching frequent waves inside your territory. You can see the invasion cooldown at the top of the Ministry of War screen. Losing a sector to them \(ie. having all your stations destroyed\) will reduce your threat level. Reminder: you gain threat every 24 hours and also when you conquer a sector. It is strongly recommended to NOT exceed Threat 5 before the first OCV invasion.\n\nYou will receive two other messages before the invasion happens.</t>

		<t id="4208">[author]\033YTutorial\033X[/author]\033YYou have just built your first Orbital Weapons Platform. Even though they appear as stations in the Sanctuary Manager, they are in fact considered as ships by the game. Thus, you can only equip them with shields, missiles and lasers by using the Freight exchange option \(a Transporter device is needed\). Note that they won't fire until their turrets are set up. Also, don't forget to give a command to the OWP itself as well, like "Attack All Enemies", otherwise the main front turrets won't fire.\n\nOWPs cannot be disassembled and cannot be relocated, but they can be self destructed like any other ships through the Additional Ship Commands menu.\n\nEach OWP is acting as a decoy and represents a priority target for the enemy.\033X</t>
		
		<t id="4209">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nWe have just built our first mining ship and it's no doubt that this will bring us wealth. However, some of our engineers have heard some strange signals from their radios when the crew started the engines. It seems that someone, or something, is tracking our mining ship with signals we have failed to amplify. However, the signals are strong and we have the feeling that if we continue to build more mining ships, they will continue to grow. The reason why we're anticipating this is that we managed to isolate a pattern in the transmission. It seems that there's a piece of droid code inside each signal layer, something we've never seen before. And if we put more mining ships into the same sector, we fear that this code is going to become out of control, and something will happen. We don't know when it will occur, or how many miners that will require, but the signals are different for each sector, meaning that a different number of ships per sector could potentially trigger a reaction. What we know however is that the pattern will start to become unstable if we run more than %s miners in the same sector. %s and below should always be safe.</t>
		<t id="4210">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nOur scouts have spotted some rogue droid ships, right in the middle of our sector %s! Just as we feared, the signals are extremely powerful now and all our mining ships seem to be affected by their underlying code. Their communications tell us they are maximizing their utility function and eliminating a competitive threat. It appears that the droids piloting these ships don't want us to mine too deep into the asteroids. Prepare for combat!</t>

A working hyerspace lane has apparently been found to a sector called Green Prism, but our budget being what it is, we cannot guarantee that a rescue team will be sent. However, I represent a trustful company and one that does not forget its friends. We can help you, but we need a ship big enough to bring supplies and men to Green Prism. Build us a TL, and we will help you.

		<t id="5012">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nWe appreciate your effort. On behalf of my company, I'd like to thank you and welcome our mutual friendship. I have sent a rescue team to Green Prism with the ship you've just built. Recent reports mention a group of Sohnen survivors living there, all by themselves. It is also said that they are constantly being attacked by bandits and looters...\n\nI'm going to be frank: sending more company ships to this location is out of the question. However, we are a galaxy-wide company and we have some knowledge you could use. For instance, we know a technology called Hyperspace Gravity Distortion that allows us to open rifts to distant parts of the galaxy. It can only be used to transport people and requires a strong station, but with a good team of marines you could rescue your people by opening such a rift from one of your Sanctuaries. Consider this a reward for all the work you have done for us in the past.\n\n\033OYou can now open Hyperspace Rifts from your Sanctuaries (with the Marine Barracks perk.) Hyperspace Rifts allow you to launch expeditions with your marines. You can then have the possibility of looting various goods. The first rift you will open will be to Green Prism.

		<t id="5013">[author]\033Y%s - Leader of the Green Prism expedition\033X[/author]Leader,\n\nThe mission in Green Prism is a success. We have rescued four soldiers who were there to protect the other survivors. Unfortunately, the whole mission was designed to let them escape the planet, so we couldn't find more people at that location, and the TL you sent has been destroyed by the Hutts. From what we know, all the survivors have fled to a sector called Blue Horizon. We don't know anything about it, but the company may be able to help you on that subject. Our report has been transferred to them.\n\n\033OThe company will contact you again shortly.\033X</t>
		<t id="5014">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nWe have read the report of your marines. You should know that Blue Horizon is an isolated sector that is well known by private companies because of its giant asteroids that supposedly contain tons of Black Crystals.\n\nWe could help you, of course, but at the moment we need to have more economical influence inside this part of the galaxy. We intend to create an insurance company to fill a gap in the market and offer to people like you some guarantees about their fighting ships. In times of war, a good insurance can make a big difference...\n\nNeedless to say, we are still weak because we refuse to go into endless conflicts, but we know how much money there is to make by doing so. We can offer you our help about Blue Horizon for %s credits. This will also let you buy insurance from our company at any time you want.\n\n\033OGive the money to the company through the Ministry of War.\033X</t>
		<t id="5015">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nOur insurance company has now started and you can insure most ships in your Sanctuaries. Keep in mind that M1 and M2 cannot be insured, and that only the price of the hull will be covered if an incident happens. Also, the incident will not be covered if the damage comes from one of your ships.\n\nThat being said, let's talk about Blue Horizon. Many of our subsidiaries have already tried to go there to exploit Black Crystals (even though no one knows how to break those giant asteroids), but with the recent OCV attacks all the hyperlanes have been sabotaged and it's now considered an unreachable sector. It was quite surprising to learn that a group of survivors could get there... So we've decided to lead an investigation. It's already in progress. I'll contact you again when we have more information.\n\n\033OThe company will contact you again shortly.\033X</t>
		<t id="5016">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nWe managed to get our hands on a rare artifact that contains crucial data. Apparently there is a way to Blue Horizon, but it requires one to build an Infinity Gate Portal. Because none of our scientists know anything about these things, we decided to give the artifact to a group of %s scientists. They should have extracted the data very quickly, but unfortunately they got chased by a %s patrol. Since then, we lost all communications with the scientists, and Battle Groups probably have the data now.\n\nBut there's a solution...

However, the physical location of the data is not important, as we can hack into it. At least we could if the firewall wasn't so hard to break... We know how to deactivate it, but it requires the destruction of an M2, where the source of the security is coming from. But not any M2... Their very own flagship!

These Infinity Gate Portals were invented by an ancient species known as the Kwa. They knew how to bend spacetime using the Force and probably had technologies we can't even imagine. In short, we need to build the portal near a gravity anomaly or it won't work. And there's only one known anomaly in this galaxy, in %s.

		<t id="1126">All manufacturing components will be added as products into this Sanctuary.</t>
		<t id="1127">This command will erase previous jobs and create news ones based on wares required to build stations and ships. A base value will be asked to determine the quantity of wares that will be setup in the Acquire jobs. All jobs created this way have Trade as target.</t>

The progress will be displayed in the name of the ship and it will only advance if the ship remains in the source sector. The ship must have enough Nividium to be able to initiate this command.

		<t id="401">This command will start the universe trader. It will trade all wares that can be bought and sold to achieve profits. If a homebase is set, then station's money is used and the UT will stay around it, otherwise the player's money will be used and the maximum trading range will be based on the UT experience. If the ship runs out of trade opportunities it will stay on standby and try again. More experience increases profits. If the UT has a homebase, it will respect its maximum trading range setting. UT experience determines the absolute maximum trading range.\n{2022,99991}</t>
		<t id="506">The Crystal Transmuter is used to create new crystals from lower quality ones. Synthesized Crystals gives Red crystals, Red gives Yellow, Yellow gives Blue and so on.</t>
		<t id="83">This command will make the fleet commander call all ships assigned to its fleet to repair if needed and if possible, join up and be ready for fleet orders. Each ship except the leader will resupply from other ships of the same fleet before joining the leader, if one of the party has a Transporter Device or if docking is possible. It will also look for a local Sanctuary or Solar Power Plant. This command affects most ships, including those who are "currently not with fleet", but not those who are already resupplying or refueling from a previous Call To Arms. This command is useful to reorganize your fleet and automatically assign fighters to your carriers. A second call may be useful if all your ships were not in the same sector or if your fighters are not properly assigned to your carriers. Note that this command makes all ships escort the leader and can therefore act as an attack command.</t>

		<t id="89">This command will order the fleet commander to organise an invasion fleet to destroy all stations in a given sector. To cause maximum confusion amongst the enemy, all ships will be assigned to a random target. If there are no stations left, the fleet will start defending the sector.</t>
		<t id="518">This ship will tug every fighter that is coming to its homebase without being able to jump. It will also tug followers when possible.</t>

		<t id="16941">Data Scanner</t>
		<t id="7172">Due to the shortage of some materials that were previously used in the making of infantry equipment, scrap metal is now often used to manufacture ammunitions, weapons and gear for marines and mercenaries. The Hutts are well known for their skills in the creation of such equipment.</t>
		<t id="15124">The Disruptor rifle is a common type of sidearm that disintegrates its target. It tears apart its victims at the molecular level, destroying tissue and bypassing many sorts of personal energy shields. Disruptor Rifles are considered highly illegal in the majority of space, even though most marines and pirates use it on a daily basis.</t>
		<t id="15114">Low-yield Sidearms(illegal), which include phase pistols and stun handguns, are widely used by many law enforcement forces and military organisations. Their limited firepower prevents them to be used during tactical assaults and boarding operations.</t>
		<t id="15134">Imperial EMP Rifles(illegal) are widely used by all Galactic Empire forces against ground vehicles and static defenses. The rifle is so big that it has to be managed by a two-man team. It's only effective against targets that are powered by electricity.</t>
		<t id="76084">Mounted Railgun</t>
		<t id="76085">The Railgun is an electric-powered weapon specifically designed to be mounted on Lasertowers. In fact, this gun is so big and so heavy that the entire Lasertower is built around it.</t>
		<t id="76086">Crystal Transmuter</t>
		<t id="76087">This equipment is designed with Black Crystals, from which it uses its remarkable properties to apply molecular transformation to any crystal in order to transmute it into a higher quality version. Synthesized Crystals are compatible. This equipment is informally known among pilots as "The Philosopher's Stone". Note that the Crystal Transmuter has gone through several upgrades over the time. The latest one allows it to drain high amount of shield energy in order to make the transmutation almost instantaneous.</t>
		<t id='2071654'>Sanctuary</t>
		<t id='2071655'>This huge station has all the necessary infrastructures to welcome a group of people and build new ships and stations. Originally designed by Rakata architects, all sanctuaries are built around an ingenious system that allows to move walls at will and create new rooms, making the whole station flexible. It also has a repair bay and a gigantic hangar.</t>
		<t id="16971">Research Station</t>
		<t id="16972">Originally designed by the Galactic Empire, this station has all the equipment needed to discover new blueprints. All research stations share the same database and can work simultaneously on the same project. As soon as a blueprint is discovered, it can be built at any shipyard.</t>
		<t id="16942">A special device used exclusively by the Sohnens. It allows the scanning of other ships in order to obtain their structural data that are required to research blueprints.</t>
		<t id="16204">Infra-red and IFF-guided Internal Sentry Lasers can be fitted in strategic locations on any ship to provide enhanced internal security in the event of intrusion or boarding. \(Adds 1 enemy in each room.\)</t>
		<t id="16194">The Hull Polarising Device produces a high-powered sustained magnetic field on a ship's hull, which can seriously disrupt even the most efficient plasma cutters, thus protecting against forced hull entry. \(Makes the hull harder to cut by increasing the required level of Engineering.\)</t>
		<t id="2413">Docking Computer</t>
		<t id="2414">This equipment allows your own ship to instantly dock to the nearest in-range station \(shift-D by default\). It has no effect on other ships.</t>
