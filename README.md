## Top 20 Changes from Mayhem 2

1. **Vanilla factions** changed to Star Wars factions:
    - Kha'ak faction changed to Rogue Mining Droids.
    - Xenon faction changed to Sith.
    - Pirate faction changed to the Hutts.
    - Hutts and Sith are extremely dangerous. Race fleets can combat them more effectively if you raise your threat level.
2. All **vanilla ships** removed (except Xenon ships).
3. Most wares are now **Star Wars-themed**.
4. Main story follows **Star Wars lore** with artistic license.
5. **Faction capital ships** can be renamed in `addon/t/9978_L044.xml`. Name them after your friends or favorite characters!
6. **New game starts**: Optionally join the Rebellion or fight for the Empire.
7. **Longer range, staggered fire turrets**.
8. Difficulty and settings adjustable in `addon/t/1000-L044.xml`.
9. Revamped **escort behavior**; can be toggled in `addon/t/9979-L044.xml`.
10. Overhauled **default ship equipment**. Many now come with Quantum Jump Gate Extensions, Transporter Devices, Docking Transporter Extensions, and Triplex Scanners, to name a few.
11. Sanctuaries build faster and start with free perks such as tax, solar panels, adjacency, and resupply drones.
12. Ships automatically orient upright with respect to the gate network. No more upside down or sideways ships.
13. **Corporations** are randomly placed within their race's territory and will respawn if destroyed. They maintain military fleets for protection.
14. Teleport to any of your ships using the **Player Console**. This will reset the ship's homebase unless it is part of a wing.
15. Factions will now use **M4, M5, and M8** ships in their Battle Fleets. Be on guard!
16. **Dock/Station Agents** will adjust jump e-cells on the fly based on Homebase trading range changes.
17. **Satellite Monitoring** now respects all player property, not just satellites.
18. All factions fight **dirty wars**. This should help late game balance and instill chaos across the galaxy.
19. Explorers will randomly pick their gates instead of all following the same path.
20. Multiple **bug fixes**.
