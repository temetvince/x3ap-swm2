**********************************************************************

Star Wars for Mayhem 2, a mod for X3: Albion Prelude. Farnham's Legacy is not supported. This mod requires Litcube's Universe and Mayhem 2, please see the install instructions in README.txt.

1. Explore the galaxy you are thrust in either yourself or with explorer ships.
2. Expand your empire using Sanctuaries, which are giant space stations, factories, and shipyards.
3. Exploit the weaknesses of your enemies, holes in the economy, or the military advances of your allies.
4. Exterminate factions which oppose you and the dreaded Omicron Channel Virus.

Thanks to Litcube for releasing Litcube's Universe.
Thanks to Joubarbe for all the Mayhem mods.
Thanks to XenonArchitect7 for his work on SWLU, which this mod borrows from heavily.

Note: This mod does not include the SWLU soundtrack.

**********************************************************************

It is !!HIGHLY!! recommended, but not required, that you install the Claim and Tug Command for Joubarbe's Satellite Monitoring by Wynarel: https://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=398916

**********************************************************************

Many settings can be changed in addon/t/1000-L044.xml.
Turn on the Autorotate feature for the player ship in addon/t/9979-L044.

**********************************************************************

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (not including Claim and Tug Command by Wynarel):

1.	Install Mayhem 2. Follow ALL the instructions, including installing Litcube's Universe: (https://www.moddb.com/mods/mayhem/downloads/mayhem-main)

IMPORTANT: When installing Mayhem Graphics, do not rename any of the optional cat/dat files yet!

2.	Copy the contents for SW Mayhem 2 from "x3 terran conflict" to your root Mayhem 2 install folder (probably named "x3 terran conflict"). It should ask you if you want to overwrite a bunch of files. Say yes!

3.	Rename the Mayhem 2 Graphics optional files you want to use to be the last cat/dat files. I recommended using the dark milky way and particles no fog options. So for example, rename "OPTION - Dark Milky Way" cat and dat to "19.cat" and "19.dat" respectively, and then rename "OPTION - Particles No Fog" cat/dat to "20.cat" and "20.dat".

And you are done! Unless you want cooler graphics, then keep reading.

**********************************************************************

Notice: This mod includes temetvince's graphics improvement mod, but you must install ReShade for it to work. Instructions included below:

1.	To use the optional ReShade mod, download and install ReShade: https://reshade.me/

2.	When asked for the game, browse and select X3AP.exe in your SW Mayhem 2 install folder.

3.	The game uses Direct3D 9.

4.	When asked, install all the shaders. Everything. All of them. Just do it.

5.	Now copy Reshade.ini and temetvince.ini from your SW Mayhem 2 mod download to your root install folder (probably named "x3 terran conflict"). The graphics mod is now installed. You can take before/after screenshots that save to your root install folder with the PrintScrn button on your keyboard. To access the options in game, press [SHIFT]+[~] (or [SHIFT]+[`]).
